                            <p>Kanaka Durga Temple is a Hindu Temple dedicated to Goddess Kanaka Durga. The deity in
                                this temple is also popularly referred as Kanaka Durga. The temple is located in
                                Vijayawada, Andhra Pradesh, India on the Indrakeeladri Hills on the banks of Krishna
                                River. Kaalika Purana, Durgaa Sapthashati and other Vedic literature have mentioned
                                about Goddess Kanaka Durga on the Indrakeelaadri and have described the deity as
                                Swayambhu, in Triteeya Kalpa.</p>
                            <p>At the Kanakadurga temple, the enchanting 4-foot-high (1.2 m) icon of the deity is
                                bedecked in glittering ornaments and bright flowers. Her icon here depicts Her
                                eight-armed form -each holding a powerful weapon- in a standing posture over the demon
                                Mahishashura and piercing him with Her trident. The goddess is the epitome of
                                beauty.[citation needed]born the result of maa kali.</p>

                            <p>The idea of constructing a dam across the river Krishna dates back to 1798. After the
                                endorsement of Major Cotton, the board of Directors of the East India
                                Company approved it on 5 January 1850. The dam was started in 1852 and completed in
                                1855. It cost Rs 1.75 crore in those days and seems to have paid the then government a
                                return of 18%. It used to irrigate 7 lakh acres. Later, the State Government
                                constructed a bridge that was named after Tanguturi Prakasam, the first Chief Minister
                                of Andhra (a state formed in 1953, which later became Andhra Pradesh in 1956 after the
                                merger of Telugu speaking districts of former Hyderabad State). Completed in 1957.</p>
                            <p>It
                                helps to irrigate over 1.2 million acres of land. This barrage also supplies water to
                                Buckingham canal which was initially constructed as an inland navigation canal but was
                                later used as an irrigation water supply canal. One of the first major irrigation
                                projects of South India, the Prakasam Barrage in Vijayawada was completely successful in
                                its mission.</p>
